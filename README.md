kconfig
=======

extraction of kconfig included with Linux kernel source tree


cepharum GmbH was looking for more instant access on kconfig to conveniently integrate it in a product's installer script. Since checking out from Linux kernel source tree is a time-wasting process this sparse clone has been started. By running our own clone we keep control over ongoing development of kconfig and how this affects integrity of our installer script.
